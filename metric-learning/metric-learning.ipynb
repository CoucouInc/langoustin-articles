    "\n",
    "# Auditory metric learning using training triplets\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "While developping [bliss](https://lelele.io/bliss.html), a program written to build \"smart\" playlists by putting together similar songs, I've come across the need to find a good distance metric to compare two songs, represented by vectors of floats. Each float represents one aspect (or one part of an aspect) of the song: tempo, timbre, chroma...\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most basic distance metric one could use to compute the distance between two songs is the [Euclidean distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance). While this method works quite well in practice, the issue is that it assumes each feature has the same weight as the others. Meaning, in our case, that for example the tempo of a song is as important as its tone when it comes to music similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, this is wrong, and while most experts will agree that a *universal* distance metric regarding songs is not a reasonable concept, I still thought that it would be possible to get an approximation of it, meaning, a distance that would make everyone roughly agree that a playlist has only similar songs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that here we make the assumption that a good playlist is a playlist made of similar songs (that might or might not \"drift\" into different genres). You might not agree, but this was set as a ground truth to simplify the study.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Choice of a distance metric\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to keep the learning somehow simple, I've chosen to use the [Mahalanobis distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahalanobis_distance) (or generalized quadratic distance):\n",
    "Let %$M$% be a [symmetric positive semi-definite matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive-definite_matrix#Positive_semidefinite) of size %$n \\times n$%, %$x$% and %$y$% two vectors of %$\\mathbb{R}^n$%, the Mahalanobis distance between %$x$% and %$y$% is defined as: %$$d_M(x, y) = \\sqrt{(x - y)^{T}M(x - y)}$$%\n",
    "\n",
    "All that is left is then to find the coefficients of %$M$% that will yield the best playlists (and yes, if M is the identify matrix, then it will simply be an Euclidean distance).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Metric learning\n",
    "\n",
    "As said before, the idea is to make playlists that most people will be happy with, so since it is such a subjective problem, we asked feedback from different people, in the form of an online survey.\n",
    "\n",
    "People were presented with three different, thirty seconds-long excerpts of songs, and had to point the one that they felt was the most dissimilar compared to the others:\n",
    "<img src=\"survey.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Each answer gives us the following information: given %$x_1$%, %$x_2$%, and %$x_3$% three songs, if the user picked %$x_2$% as the odd one out, then if %$d_M$% is the distance metric, we know that %$d_M(x_1, x_3) < d_M(x_1, x_2)$% and %$d_M(x_1, x_3) < d_M(x_2, x_3)$%. That is, it tells us that the first and the third song are closer together than they both are to the second song.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then need to find the matrix %$M$% that respects all these constraints, or as much as possible if it can't fit all.\n",
    "We can prove that solving this can be seen as a simple minimization problem without constraints (see [this, 4.1](https://lelele.io/thesis.pdf) if you want the detailed explanation).\n",
    "\n",
    "We show that the function to minimize is, with %$(x_i, x_j, x_k)$% being a training triplet where %$x_k$% is chosen to be the odd one out, %$M = LL^T$, $\\mathcal{R}$% being the set of all songs' indexes, %$\\Phi$% the [cumulative Gaussian distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function), and %$\\sigma$% a fixed parameter:\n",
    " %$$ f(L, x_i, x_j, x_k, \\sigma) = -\\sum_{i,j,k \\in \\mathcal{R}} \\log \\left(\\Phi\\left(\\frac{d_L(x_k, x_i) - d_L(x_i, x_j)}{\\sigma^2}\\right)\\right) $$%\n",
    "\n",
    "A quick check allows us to see that that the reasoning is roughly correct: to minimize this function correctly, the term in %$log$% needs to be close to one, and the cumulative distribution function gets close to one when %$d_L(x_k, x_i) > d_L(x_j, x_k)$%, which is the condition we try to match.\n",
    "\n",
    "After a trial-and-error process, we noticed that adding a regularization parameter %$\\lambda$% was useful to avoid overfitting, which made the final function: %$$f(L, x_i, x_j, x_k, \\sigma, \\lambda) = -\\sum_{i,j,k \\in \\mathcal{R}} \\log \\left(\\Phi\\left(\\frac{d_L(x_k, x_i) - d_L(x_i, x_j)}{\\sigma^2}\\right)\\right) + \\lambda \\left|\\left|L\\right|\\right|$$%"

    "Metric learning using training triplets does increase accuracy, but not by far. Several explanations are possible:\n",
    "* There were not enough answers, i.e. training triplets to perform both the training and the testing correctly\n",
    "* People were not coherent enough in their answers (we could've checked for instance that there were no contradicting answers). This has been naively taken care of in \"Small improvements in metric learning\", but can probably be improved by filtering further on incorrect relationship\n",
    "* The \"universal\" music distance metric is a chimera, and people have actually really (and not slightly) different interpretation of \"music distance\"\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it doesn't mean that training triplets are useless per se. This code could perfectly be reused in another field with less subjective answers (which is the \"why\" of this blogpost - show working code for metric learning using training triplets, as I haven't been able to find any). One could also try to derive \"personalized\" distance metrics, instead of trying to find a general and universal one, by asking a specific user to fill in this kind of survey on their own music, and derive a metric from their personal taste."
